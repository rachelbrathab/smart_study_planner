# Smart Study Planner

Smart Study Planner is a Flask web app that helps students build study schedules, track session completion, and view progress history.

## Features

- User signup/login/logout with session-based auth
- Custom study-plan generation from:
	- Subjects and topic counts
	- Available time slots
	- Pomodoro tiers (`light`, `standard`, `deep`)
- Auto-generated schedule with study and break sessions
- Progress tracking with:
	- Complete session
	- Undo last completed session
	- Percent complete and next session
- Study history dashboard with subject distribution chart

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Flask
- Gunicorn (production server)
- Server-side rendered HTML templates
- JSON file storage for users/plans

	app.py                    # Flask app and routes
	src/planner.py            # Schedule generation logic
	templates/                # Jinja templates (pages)
	static/                   # CSS and client-side JS

	requirements.txt
	pyproject.toml
	render.yaml               # Render deployment config
```

## Quick Start (Local)

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## How to Use

1. Sign up at `/signup` (or log in at `/login`).
2. On `/`, enter subjects, difficulty, topic counts, and time slots.
3. Choose a Pomodoro tier and generate a plan.
4. View schedule at `/schedule`.
5. Track completion at `/progress`.
6. Review past plans at `/history`.

## Deployment

### Can this be deployed on GitHub Pages?

No. GitHub Pages only serves static files, while this app needs a Python server.

### Recommended deployment: Render

This repo includes `render.yaml` with:

- `buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `startCommand: gunicorn app:app`
- Python version pinning

Deploy steps:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In Render, create a new Web Service from that repo.
3. Render auto-detects `render.yaml`.
4. Deploy.

## Environment Variables

- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: recommended for production session security.

Note: the current app sets a hardcoded secret in `app.py`. For production, update the app to read the secret from environment variables.

## Data Storage Notes

Current persistence uses local JSON files:

- `data/users.json`
- `data/plans.json`

On free/ephemeral hosting, local disk can reset on redeploy/restart. For durable production data, migrate to a database (for example SQLite or Postgres).

## Troubleshooting

- If `ModuleNotFoundError` appears, re-activate your venv and reinstall dependencies.
- If port conflicts occur locally, stop the conflicting process or set `PORT` before running.
- If login/session behavior is inconsistent in production, verify secret key configuration.

## Future Improvements

- Replace JSON storage with a real database
- Hash passwords instead of storing plain text
- Add automated tests for route and planner logic
- Move secret key handling fully to environment variables
